AUTHORS: Ross Grogan-Kaylor and Jimmy Zhong

DATA: a dataset of 500+ Pokemon and their attributes, such as types (e.g. water, fire, grass, electric, flying, etc.) and abilities (e.g. berserk, dazzling, fur coat, gluttony, etc.).

Our dataset comes from https://www.kaggle.com/mrdew25/pokemon-database.

STATUS:

- the home page works great.
- 

NOTES: a substantial amount of effort went into writing the InfinitePokemonCardScroller class. Jimmy got the infinite scrolling to work in the first place, and Ross did the abstraction. It's possible that Ross spent too much time on this class instead of on other features. (Ross wrote this, so no, Jimmy is not throwing Ross under the bus here!)
