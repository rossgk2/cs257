REQUEST: /pokemon/?[id_range=_id_range]&[name_contains=_name_contains]&[legendary=_leg]&[type1=_type1]&[type2=_type2]&[ability1=_ability1]&[ability2=_ability2]&[hidden_ability=_hidden_ability]&[health_range=_health_range]&[attack_range=_attack_range]&[defense_range=_defense_range]&[special_attack_range=_special_attack_range]&[special_defense_range=_special_defense_range]&[speed_range=_speed_range]&[region=_region]&[catch_rate_range=_catch_rate_range]&[growth_type=&growth_type]&[male_percent_range=_male_percent_range]&[game=_game]&[egg_group1=_egg_group_1]&[egg_group2=_egg_group2]&[sort_field=_sort_field]&[sort_type=_sort_type]

RESPONSE: a JSON list of Pokemon names of Pokemon such that the filters are satisfied. The arguments sort_field and sort_type determine how the returned JSON list is sorted.

sort_field may be: "id", "name", "type1", "type2", "ability1", "ability2", "hidden_ability", "health", "attack", "defense", "special_attack", "special_defense", "speed", "region", "catch_rate", "growth_type", "male_percent", "game", "egg_group1", "egg_group2".

sort_type may be "ascending" or "descending". (If the variable represented by sort_field is a string, sorting is done alphabetically/reverse-alphabetically, and if the variable represented by sort_field is a number, sorting is done in increasing/decreasing order).
