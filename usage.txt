usage: books.py [-h] [-b BOOKS [BOOKS ...]] [-a AUTHORS [AUTHORS ...]] [year1] [year2]

Tool for searching for books in the 'books.csv' file written by specified authors during a time period. During the time interval [min(year1, year2), max(year1, year2)] (this
interval is assumed to be "all time" if unspecified), this command considers authors whose names contain (one of) the substring(s) specified by --author or -a (if no substring
is specified, all relevant authors are searched), and then finds the books whose titles contain (one of) the substring(s) specified by --books or -b that were written by these
authors (if no substring is specified, all relevant books are considered).

positional arguments:
  year1                 One of the years in the time interval [min(year1, year2), max(year1, year2)] within which to search for books.
  year2                 One of the years in the time interval [min(year1, year2), max(year1, year2)] within which to search for books.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -b BOOKS [BOOKS ...], --books BOOKS [BOOKS ...]
                        One or more substrings to search for in the titles of books. If one of the substrings contains a space, surround that substring with quotes "".
  -a AUTHORS [AUTHORS ...], --authors AUTHORS [AUTHORS ...]
                        One or more substrings to search for in the names of authors. If one of the substrings contains a space, surround that substring with quotes "".

Any specification of arguments is allowed. That is, one may specify only books, only authors, only years, only books and authors, only books and years, only authors and years,
all of books, authors, and years, or none at all. HOWEVER, if any years are specified, the years arguments, which are positional, must come before any of the other arguments,
which are optional. Specifying only one year Y is the same as specifying year1 = year2 = Y.
