--events (-e) lists every olympian to compete in a certain event (one argument)

Guide:
In order to print a list of all athletes who are from a certain NOC contain, use python3  --athletesfrom USA or -a USA
In order to print a list of all NOCs by medal count (descending) use python3  --nocbymedals S or -n S
In order to print a list of all athletes who competed in an event use python3 --events Wrestling or -e Wrestling
If several tags are the program will print a list that meet the requirements of one of the tags conditions. It will print each list one at a time. So single argument only will effect it only. (think of it as an "Or" instead of an "And").
